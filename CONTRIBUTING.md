# Development

Before running anything, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

## Running the interface locally

```
yarn start
```

The interface should automatically open. If it does not, navigate to [http://localhost:3000].

## Creating a production build

```
yarn build
```

To serve the production build:

```
yarn serve
```

Then, navigate to [http://localhost:3000] to see it.

## Running unit tests

```
yarn test
```

By default, this runs only unit tests that have been affected since the last commit. To run _all_ unit tests:

```
yarn test --watchAll
```
